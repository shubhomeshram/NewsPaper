                        LSG, who sit on the third spot on the points table. Capitals on the other hand are languishing at the bottom of the points table with the worst net run rate of -1.370.
                        
                        Delhi Capitals has struggled to find the silver lining in their 2024 campaign barring skipper Rishabh Pant and Tristan Stubb’s form. The main issue is the team’s lack of depth in Indian talent on the bench. This deficiency does not instil confidence in the team</p>

                        <p class="info">
                            SpaceX’s Starship, the biggest and most powerful rocket in history, took off from the company’s Starbase facility in Boca Chica at 6.55 PM IST on Thursday. Unlike its previous two test flights, this time, the Elon Musk-led company’s mega-rocket did not explode, and it inserted the spacecraft into orbit. But after that, SpaceX confirmed that it lost the spacecraft.

The Starship rocket went farther than it did during the previous two flights but SpaceX said it lost communication with the spacecraft when it was reentering Earth’s atmosphere. It was supposed to splash down in the Indian Ocean but it most likely disintegrated or broke apart due to the stress of reentry.

But it would be wrong to think of the third test flight as a complete failure. It completed many mission objectives in a massive step forward for the spacecraft and launch system that Musk believes will take humanity to the Moon.

                        <p class="info">Starship’s development and delays in flight-readiness could have massive implications for human space exploration. NASA’s Artemis 3 mission, which is set to be the first to land astronauts on the Moon since Apollo 17 in 1972, could be delayed if Starship is not ready in time.</p>

                    <p class="info">SpaceX's huge Super Heavy-Starship rocket successfully boosted its unpiloted upper stage into space Thursday. The rocket was lost once it entered Earth's atmosphere.
                            The American space agency in 2021 selected SpaceX to develop the first commercial human lander that will carry astronauts to the lunar surface. The four astronauts who will be part of Artemis 3 will travel to the Moon in NASA’s Orion spacecraft launched by the agency’s Space Launch System (SLS). Those two systems have already been tested and validated during the Artemis 1 mission and will be tested again during Artemis 2, which will take astronauts on a journey to the Moon and back without landing.
                            
                            But after astronauts reach lunar orbit during the Artemis 3 mission, two of them will be transferred to a human landing system (HLS) variant of Starship, which will be tasked with taking the astronauts to the lunar surface and then bringing them back to orbit at the end of surface operations.</p>

With day 4 collection into account, Maidaan has managed to mint ₹ 21.85 crore so far. The report also stated that Maidaan had around 24.29% Hindi Occupancy on its fourth day.

                                    Maidaan is facing stiff competition at the box office from Akshay Kumar and Tiger Shroff-starrer Bade Miyan Chote Miyan, which is an action spectacle directed by Ali Abbas Zafar. The film has collected over ₹40 cr so far. The report states that Maidaan has now minted around ₹ 6.25 crore as per early estimates. It is the highest single day collection for the film so far, yet the numbers have not been able to reach double digits.</p>

                    <p class="info">Infosys Ltd. and Wipro Ltd. are expected to kick off the Indian earnings season on a somber note as financial services clients kept information technology budgets tight.Fiscal fourth-quarter revenue at Infosys, the country’s No. 2 IT services company, probably grew modestly. Wipro, India’s fourth-biggest provider, may post lower sales. Accenture Plc lowered its revenue outlook last month, citing a pullback in software spending by Wall Street firms, which are among the Indian companies’ biggest clients.  
                        <br><br>
                        With discretionary projects from clients getting delayed, cost cuts should support earnings going ahead, according to Nomura analysts Abhishek Bhandari and Krish Beriwal. Comments on budgets for 2024 and the ramp-up of projects will be tracked closely by investors, they said. For Wipro, the recent resignation of Chief Executive Officer Thierry Delaporte brought uncertainty at a time when investors want to see a turnaround. 
                        Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. saw quarterly revenue surge the most since 2022 with the AI chip boom. Investors might also be interested in how it’s dealing with this month’s earthquake in Taiwan. Its biggest temblor in 25 years caused minor disruptions for TSMC and its long-term outlook should remain stable with strong demand, Bloomberg Intelligence said. It will also benefit from US plans to award $11.6 billion in grants and loans to build factories.

                        <br><br>
                        <b>Monday: CATL (300750 CH)</b> probably saw first-quarter revenue drop 8.8 per cent, two estimates show, as electric-vehicles demand slows down. Chairman Robin Zeng isn’t worried about overcapacity and intends to boost output of the company’s more technologically advanced products. The battery maker’s plans to build batteries at a Michigan plant owned by Ford Motor Co. bodes well for its long-term market share, BI said.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Thursday: Infosys’ (INFO IN)</b> annual revenue likely grew at the slowest pace since the 2018 fiscal year, consensus shows. Fourth-quarter profit probably edged higher, with salary hikes denting margins. It gets almost a third of revenue from financial services and insurance companies, which have been among the worst-hit verticals for client spending. Investors will look for updates on the InSemi Technology acquisition and the rollout of €1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) deal with Liberty Global, ICICI Securities analysts said. 
                        <br><br>
                        <b>TSMC (2330 TT)</b> will post strong first-quarter results due to advanced node processes and advanced chip-packaging technology, BI said. The company maintained its full-year revenue guidance of low-to-mid twenties percentage growth following the Taiwan earthquake. US financial support for TSMC to build factories in Arizona exceeded analysts’ expectations. Goldman Sachs said the facilities would likely be used by large US customers including Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Bajaj Auto’s (BJAUT IN)</b> fiscal-year adjusted net income likely expanded 30 per cent, consensus shows. While it saw favorable volume growth and stable raw material cost, the increasing electric vehicle mix in its portfolio may hold back Ebitda margin expansion, Prabhudas Lilladher said. The firm has been expanding its domestic market share with strong volume performance in exports and surge in EV volumes, Nuvama said.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Friday: Wipro (WPRO IN)</b> will probably see profit shrink for a second straight year. Investors will want to hear incoming CEO Srinivas Pallia’s comments on client spending trends. Pallia, who was previously CEO of part of the Americas business, took over on April 7 after Delaporte quit in the middle of his term. Some analysts said the elevation of an internal candidate meant Wipro’s execution issues may persist, while others said his three decades at the firm bodes well.
